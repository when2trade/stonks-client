# Stonks VR Client

## Setup
Clone this repo, then download and import the [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) package. You can uncheck/delete the AudioManager, Avatar, LipSync, Spatializer and Platform folders if you want, we're not using them currently (and they make biig metadata).

Also requires [this FPS Counter package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/graphy-ultimate-fps-counter-stats-monitor-debugger-105778) and [this UI package](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/src/master/), which I'm not sure if were' allowed to redistribute.

Dataset files & Finnhub API should be placed in Assets/Resources/Data. We're not allowed to redistribute our dataset (it was provided by our sponsor company) although early methods for analysing them can be found in the stonks-analysis repo.
