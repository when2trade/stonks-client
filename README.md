# Stonks VR Client

## Setup
Clone this repo, then download and import the [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) package. You can uncheck/delete the AudioManager, Avatar, LipSync, Spatializer and Platform folders if you want, we're not using them currently (and they make biig metadata).

Also requires [this FPS Counter package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/graphy-ultimate-fps-counter-stats-monitor-debugger-105778), which I don't think we're allowed to redistribute. Also the file for the demo ticker data should be at Assets/Data/tickersTemp.txt.
