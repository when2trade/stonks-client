## Usage
Clone this repo, then download and import the [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) package. You can uncheck/delete the AudioManager, Avatar, LipSync, Spatializer and Platform folders if you want, we're not using them currently (and they make biig metadata).
